## Hi, I'm Michael Ellis

*What happens when you put a Bayesian statistician in a room with production ML systems?*

I'm a Staff Data Scientist at Walmart, where I build probabilistic ML systems and conversational AI that serve millions of customers. But the work I'm most proud of happens in the open.

I started contributing to open source because I kept finding gaps — a missing metric in sktime, a diagnostic that should exist in NumPyro, an evaluation tool HuggingFace didn't have yet. So I built them. Each contribution started with a real problem I hit at work and ended with a merged PR that helps the whole community.

### What I'm Building

**[LMT](https://github.com/michaelellis003/LMT)** — I wanted to deeply understand transformer architectures, so I implemented GPT from scratch in PyTorch. Not a tutorial — a full pretraining and fine-tuning pipeline you can actually use.

**[gaussian-process](https://github.com/michaelellis003/gaussian-process)** — Spatial inference is underserved in the R ecosystem. This package implements Gaussian process regression with proper uncertainty quantification for geospatial applications.

**[sequential-monte-carlo-hmm](https://github.com/michaelellis003/sequential-monte-carlo-hmm)** — Particle filtering for hidden Markov models. Born from a need to do online inference in non-Gaussian state space models where Kalman filters break down.

### Open Source

I contribute to the tools I use daily. In **sktime**, I've added multiple forecast accuracy metrics that were missing from the framework. In **NumPyro**, I implemented PSIS k-hat diagnostics so practitioners can assess when their variational approximations fail. In **HuggingFace Evaluate**, I built a label distribution entropy metric for detecting dataset imbalance.
