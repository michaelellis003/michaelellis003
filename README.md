# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael Ellis

## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m a **Data Scientist** with a skill set that spans **data science**, **statistics**, and **machine learning engineering**. My main interest involves how **probability theory** can quantify uncertainty and enhance decision-making processes. Over the years, my work has revolved around:
- **Generative AI**: Exploring cutting-edge approaches to deploy LLMs in real-world applications.
- **Bayesian Methodology**: Applying scalable Bayesian methods to time series, spatial, and other high-dimensional data.
- **Experimental Design**: Creating robust A/B testing frameworks to drive business strategies and product development.

### **Industry Experience**
- **Black Hills Energy** (Data Scientist):
  - Developed a large-scale forecasting system to predict natural gas consumption, utilizing scalable Bayesian methods to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty. I built an R Shiny application that allowed stakeholders to visualize and monitor forecasts in real-time. These insights were communicated to senior leadership, directly informing resource planning and strategic decision-making. 
  
- **The Home Depot** (Data Scientist & Senior Data Scientist):
  - My current work involves collaborating with a cross-functional teamâ€”including product managers, engineers, and UX designersâ€”to enhance the customer experience within our contact center. We leverage cutting-edge technologies in generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and natural language processing (NLP) to design and maintain a task-oriented dialogue system capable of autonomously answering customer questions and completing tasks without human intervention.
    
### **Education**
I completed my academic studies at the University of Arkansas, where I earned:
- A **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics**.
- A **Masterâ€™s degree in Statistics**, with a research focus on scalable Bayesian methodologies for high-dimensional data.
  - My Masterâ€™s thesis, Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Hidden Markov Models, explored computational techniques for efficiently performing Bayesian inference on sequential data.

I also completed two years of coursework toward a PhD in Mathematics, which included: Measure-Theory Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Experimental Design, Computational Statistics, Real Analysis, and Partial Differential Equations.
