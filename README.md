## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm Michael Ellis, a **Senior Data Scientist** who bridges the worlds of **data science**, **statistics**, and **machine learning engineering**. I'm passionate about leveraging probability theory to quantify uncertainty and enable better data-driven decision-making. Over the years, my work has revolved around:

- **Generative AI**: Exploring cutting-edge approaches to **Generative AI**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **large language models (LLMs)** in real-world applications.
- **Bayesian Methodology**: Applying scalable Bayesian methods to high-dimensional data.
- **Experimental Design**: Creating robust trustworthy controlled experimentation (**A/B testing**) frameworks to drive business strategies and product development.

## ðŸ’¼ Industry Experience

### The Home Depot (Data Scientist & Senior Data Scientist)
- Collaborated with a cross-functional teamâ€”including product managers, engineers, and UX designersâ€”to enhance the customer experience within our contact center.
- Leveraged cutting-edge technologies in generative AI, large language models (LLMs), and natural language processing (NLP) to design, deploy, and maintain a task-oriented dialogue system capable of autonomously answering customer questions and completing tasks without human intervention.

### Black Hills Energy (Data Scientist)
- Developed a large-scale forecasting system to predict natural gas consumption, utilizing scalable Bayesian methods to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty.
- Built an R Shiny application that allowed stakeholders to visualize and monitor forecasts in real-time.
- Communicated insights to senior leadership, directly informing resource planning and strategic decision-making.

## ðŸŽ“ Education

I completed my academic studies at the University of Arkansas, where I earned:
- A **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics**.
- A **Masterâ€™s degree in Statistics**, with a research focus on scalable Bayesian methodologies for high-dimensional data.
  - My Masterâ€™s thesis, [**Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Hidden Markov Models**](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4519&context=etd), explored computational techniques for efficiently performing Bayesian inference on sequential data.

I also completed two years of coursework toward a PhD in Mathematics, which included:
- Measure-Theory Probability
- Mathematical Statistics
- Experimental Design and Causal Inference
- Computational Statistics
- Real Analysis
- Partial Differential Equations
