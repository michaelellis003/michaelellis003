<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Michael!</h1>
Iâ€™m a Data Scientist at The Home Depot, currently working on the Conversational AI team, focused on optimizing our contact center experience.

Very generally, I am interested in how probability theory can be used to quantify uncertainty and improve decision making. As a part of the Conversational AI team at The Home Depot, my recent work has been focused on generative AI and Large Language Models.
