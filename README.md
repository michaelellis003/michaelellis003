<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Michael Ellis</h1>
I am currently graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arkansas. My main interest is in using probability theory and statistical methods to improve decision making. In particular, I am interested in Bayesian statistical methods for time-series, spatial and spatio-temporal data, time efficient full and approximate Bayesian inference for large datasets, and Bayesian nonparametrics.
