## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Michael Ellis, a Senior Data Scientist with expertise spanning data science, statistics, and machine learning engineering. I'm passionate about leveraging probability theory to quantify uncertainty—enabling data-driven decision-making—and building scalable, robust scientific software to solve complex problems. Over the years, my work has revolved around:

- **Conversational AI**: Building task-oriented dialogue AI agents answering questions and completing tasks without human intervention.
- **Experimental Design**: Creating robust trustworthy controlled experimentation (A/B testing) and causal inference frameworks to drive business strategies and product development.
- **Bayesian Methodology**: Applying scalable Bayesian methods to high-dimensional data.
  
## 💼 Industry Experience

### The Home Depot (Data Scientist & Senior Data Scientist)
- Collaborated with a cross-functional team—including product managers, engineers, and UX designers—to enhance the customer experience within our contact center.
- Leveraged cutting-edge technologies in generative AI, large language models (LLMs), retrival-agumented generation (RAG) and natural language processing (NLP) to design, deploy, and maintain a task-oriented dialogue AI agents answering questions and completing tasks without human intervention.
- Led the design and implementation of a robust A/B testing framework—from hypothesis formulation and sample size determination to automated result analysis—driving data-driven decisions and enabling accurate causal inferences when experiments were infeasible.

### Black Hills Energy (Data Scientist)
- Developed a large-scale forecasting system to predict natural gas consumption, utilizing scalable Bayesian methods to generate probabilistic forecasts with quantified uncertainty.
- Built an R Shiny application that allowed stakeholders to visualize and monitor forecasts in real-time.
- Communicated insights to senior leadership, directly informing resource planning and strategic decision-making.

## 🎓 Education

I completed my academic studies at the University of Arkansas, where I earned:
- A **Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics**.
- A **Master’s degree in Statistics**, with a research focus on scalable Bayesian methodologies for high-dimensional data.
  - My Master’s thesis, [**Sequential Monte Carlo Methods for Hidden Markov Models**](https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4519&context=etd), explored computational techniques for efficiently performing Bayesian inference on sequential data.

I also completed two years of coursework toward a PhD in Mathematics, which included:
- Measure-Theory Probability
- Mathematical Statistics
- Experimental Design and Causal Inference
- Computational Statistics
- Real Analysis
- Partial Differential Equations
