<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Michael!</h1>
I am currently a Data Scientist at The Home Depot on the conversational AI team. Previously, I was a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arkansas. Generally, I am interested in using probability theory and statistical and machine learning methods to improve decision making. In particular, I am interested in time efficient full and approximate Bayesian methods for large time-series, spatial, and spatio-temporal datasets.
